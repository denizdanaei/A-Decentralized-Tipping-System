# Human research ethics

If you intend to perform some research activity that involves human participants (e.g. questionnaire, observation, interview, usability evaluation of your product), you should follow TUD [regulations](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/strategiedocumenten-tu-delft/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/) about human research. For this course, we recommend that you only set up human research that the university regards as minimal risk. Before you engage in human research activity make sure of the following

1. Use the self-assessment [tool](https://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/ethicsinresearcheducation/index.php/sheet/) to check if your human research activity is regarded as minimal risk. Note that if the self-assessment considers your study as extensive risk study, it will suggest submitting your proposal to the TUD Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). Applying for approval from HREC will not fit with the time constraints of the course. You are therefore advice only to plan for a minimal risk study.

2. Consider [EU General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.eugdpr.org/) (GDPR) (Informed Consent, anonymisation, ‘privacy by design principle’, safe storage). For information see [guidelines](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/TUDelft/Over_TU_Delft/Strategie/Integriteitsbeleid/Research%20ethics/GDPR_students.pdf) for student research

3. Create informed consent (see [guidelines and template](https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/strategie/strategiedocumenten-tu-delft/integriteitsbeleid/human-research-ethics/template-informed-consent-form/))

4. Discuss your plans with your supervisor
